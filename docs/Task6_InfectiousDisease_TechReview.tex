\section{Overview} 
\subsection{Statement of Work} 
The collaboration between JHU/APL and the UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data has provided research, support, and development of models to inform humanitarian intervention strategies by both governments and the humanitarian community. In 2020, this work primarily focused on the effects of COVID-19 and the development of the OCHA-Bucky model. Documentation on data requirements, approach, and standard operating procedures, including training materials, for the OCHA-Bucky model has previously been provided by JHU/APL to UN OCHA over the course of this effort; appropriate documentation for these tasks may be found \MYhref{https://data.humdata.org/dataset/2048a947-5714-4220-905b-e662cbcd14c8/resource/2d9592f8-2980-4466-96f5-f0de23ea7ffa/download/ochabucky_final.pdf}{here} and \MYHref{https://ocha-bucky.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{here}.

While modelling COVID-19 in humanitarian regions remains a priority for OCHA country offices, partner organisations, and ministries of health, the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 crisis may manifest themselves indirectly in plans and actions for other infectious diseases.  As such, this document details the procedures that may be taken to model other infectious diseases that may be impacted by interventions put into place during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For this effort, we will focus on cholera, malaria, and measles as use cases. These diseases are most prevalent in humanitarian regions of interest, and most related to, and therefore directly impacted by, the mitigation efforts put into place during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Models presented herein are three variants on the classic SIR model \cite{basicSIR} where each disease and each geographic region are parameterized independently. In addition to a baseline set of parameters, designed to most closely align with historical data, each model is also designed as a simulation tool wherein different scenarios that might effect disease spread can be run. Scenarios are recommended to include a worst case, best case, and ``business as usual" scenario which should be considered the most likely given the current situation as described by the data and inputs from country offices and stakeholders.   Each of these models is designed to give insight into the mid-term effects of characteristics associated with disease spread as well as the distribution of effects that might be observed in the presence of extra-ordinary circumstances (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, flooding, large infusion of resources, etc.).
 




\section{Workflow and Methodology}

\subsection{SIR Models}
\label{sec:SIR}
The SIR model framework is one of the most widely used modeling techniques for considering community spread of infectious diseases \cite{basicSIR}.  Disease dynamics are modelled over time by probabilistically moving individual members of the population through a series of compartments (otherwise known as "bins" or "states").  Those states are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Susceptible (S): the fraction of the population that could be potentially subjected to the infection;
    \item Exposed (E): the fraction of the population that has been infected but does not show symptoms yet;
    \item Infectious (I): the fraction of the population that is infective after the latent period;
    \item Recovered (R): the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered from the infection.\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent The total population is represented by the sum of the compartments.  Basic assumptions of this type of model include: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Once the model is initialized, no individuals are added to the susceptible group.  It follows that births and natural deaths are unaccounted for, migration into and out of the region is frozen for the duration of a simulation, and none of the population has been vaccinated or is immune to the pathogen;
    \item The population within each strata is uniform, and each pair of individuals within the strata are equally likely to interact;
    \item The probability of interaction between individuals in the population is not rare;
    \item Once infected, an individual cannot be reinfected with the virus; 
	\item Models for each disease are developed independently, and joint effects between models of multiple diseases are not considered.
\end{itemize}

The infectious diseases chosen, along with the geographic scale on which they are modelled, meet the conditions described above and therefore qualify as candidates to be modeled in this way.  We have considered the body of literature related to modelling cholera, malaria, and measles and have chosen three candidate models as a base on which to build our sub-national infectious disease models.  Details for the cholera model are given in Section \ref{sec:cholera};  details for the malaria model are given in Section \ref{sec:Malaria}; and details for the measles model are given in Section \ref{sec:Measles}.

Somalia is the use-case for which we have developed each of these models.  Baseline models, are presented in Section \ref{sec:Simulations}.  The goal of this work is to use this framework as the first steps towards the creation of a ``scenario modelling environment" in which decision makers can model the effects of a number of different public health outcomes depending on current and future plans. A summary of the general framework, as well as the external factors that might lead to the need for planning scenario building within the model are given in Figure \ref{fig:basicFramework}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Selection}
A number of models were reviewed and evaluated for their potential to be used in this task.  A listing of evaluated models can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{sec:Appendix}. Final models were selected based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item the number of citations the model has;
    \item the thoroughness of the documentation included in the manuscript;
    \item the ability of the model to be parameterized to real world data; and
    \item the amenability of the model to parameter adjustments for the purposes of building scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Parameterization and Implementation}
\label{sec:Parameterization}
Each model is currently implemented in Python Version 3.8 with code and associated documentation provided by JHU/APL.

Model parameterization is performed via a least squares fit (performed via the python function \textit{``Fit"} contained in the \textit{symfit} library of python).  The quantity being minimized is the difference between model output and available data regarding the percentage of infected individuals in a geographical region at the given time points.


\section{Models}
\subsection{Cholera}
\label{sec:cholera}
\subsubsection{Model Overview}
Literature is rich with various mathematical models of cholera.  For this task, we have chosen the model developed in {
\MYhref{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6676578/pdf/13104_2019_Article_4504.pdf}{Nyabadza et al}} \cite{cholera}.  The following documentation explains the developed cholera model and draws heavily from \cite{cholera}.

Presented here is a compartmental deterministic
mathematical model with a suitable treatment function
in order to study the impact of limited hospital resource
capacity on Cholera disease. The number of available
hospital beds per 10,000 (hospital bed:population ratio)
is used by health planners as a method of estimating
resource availability to the public. This model incorporates a disease recovery rate that is a function of the capacity of the health care system in terms of hospital bed-population ratio.

\subsubsection{Cholera Background}
 Cholera is an acute gastro-intestinal infection and waterborne disease which is caused by the bacterium \textit{Vibrio
Cholerae}, \textit{V. cholerae} O1 or O139. Bacterial cholera infection induces vomiting and diarrhea, and when patients are treated with delay, it can lead to severe dehydration and death within few hours. The disease has two modes
of transmission: direct transmission (human–human), which is very uncommon, and indirect transmission (environment–human), which occurs by a human ingesting contaminated food or water.

An estimated $100,000 - 120,000$ deaths are due to cholera every year in the world with only a small proportion being reported to World Health Organization (WHO).


\subsubsection{Modelling Cholera}
A diagram displaying the components of the Nyabadza cholera model is given in Figure \ref{fig:CholeraDiagram}.  The corresponding system of equations is given by Equation System (\ref{eqn:choleraEquations}).  Descriptions of the variables and parameters are given in Tables \ref{table:CholeraVariables} and \ref{table:CholeraParameters} respectively.

The cholera model developed by Nyabadza, et al. classifies the human population at
time $t$, denoted by $N(t)$, into susceptible individuals $S(t)$,
cholera infected individuals $I(t)$ and recovered individuals $R(t)$, such that: $$N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)$$ 
An additional compartment $B(t)$, representing the concentration of \textit{V. cholerae} in contaminated water has also been  incorporated in the model. Further description of the variables given in System (\ref{eqn:choleraEquations}) are defined in Table \ref{table:CholeraVariables}.

\subsection{Malaria} 
\label{sec:Malaria}
\subsubsection{Model Overview}
Malaria is well studied both in terms of biology as well as associated models of the disease processes.  For this task, we have chosen the model developed in {\MYhref{http://streaming.ictp.it/preprints/P/99/158.pdf}{Ngwa and Shu}} \cite{malaria}.  The following documentation explains the aforementioned model and draws heavily from \cite{malaria}.


In \cite{malaria}, a deterministic differential equation model for endemic malaria involving variable human and mosquito populations is presented. Humans are modeled using an SEIR model, while mosquitoes are modeled via an SIR model.




\subsubsection{Malaria Background}
 Malaria is a parasitic vector borne disease endemic in many parts of the world.  At present, at least 300 million people are affected worldwide, and there are between 1-1.5 million malaria related deaths annually. The endemicity and prevalence of malaria varies within and between countries due to environmental factors such as climate, rainfall, and mosquito population, as well as resistance of malaria parasites to anti-malarial drugs. Malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus \textit{Plasmodium}. The parasites are transmitted from person to person by a mosquito, of the genus \textit{Anopheles}, each time the infected insect takes a blood meal. On average the incubation period of \textit{P. falciparum} is about 12 days in humans and about 10 days in mosquitoes. 

\pagebreak 

\subsubsection{Modeling Malaria}

A diagram displaying the components of the Ngwa malaria model is given in Figure \ref{fig:MalariaDiagram}.  The corresponding system of equations is given by Equation System (\ref{eqn:malariaEquations}).  

The Ngwa malaria model, System (\ref{eqn:malariaEquations}) contains human and vector populations that are divided into classes or states containing susceptible, incubating, infectious and immune individuals. At time $t$, there are $S_h$ susceptible humans, $E_h$ incubating humans, $I_h$ infectious humans, $R_h$ immune humans, $S_v$ susceptible mosquitoes, $E_v$ incubating mosquitoes and $I_v$
 infectious mosquitoes. The mosquito population does not have
an immune class since their infective period ends with their death. 
$$Nh = S_h + E_h + I_h + R_h
\text{\hspace*{.2in} and \hspace*{.2in}}
N_v = S+v + E_v + I_v$$

\noindent are respectively the total human and vector populations at time $t$. The
model assumes all newborns are susceptible in both populations and a
uniform birth rate. The per capita birth rates for humans and mosquitoes are $\lambda_h$ and $\lambda_v$ respectively. Immune human individuals loose their immunity at a rate $\beta_h$. Incubating individuals in both populations become infectious with rates $\nu_h$ and $\nu_v$. Infectious human individuals either recover without any substantial gain in immunity at rate $r_h$, or join the susceptible class or with rate $\alpha_h$ signifying a period of immunity before joining the susceptible class. All individuals in both human and mosquito populations experience per capita death rates of $f_h(N_h)$, $f_v(N_v)$ respectively and infected human individuals die from the disease at the additional rate $\gamma_h$.  Descriptions of the variables and parameters associated with System (\ref{eqn:malariaEquations}) are given in Tables \ref{table:MalariaVariables} and \ref{table:MalariaParameters} respectively.

\subsection{Measles} 
\label{sec:Measles}

\subsubsection{Model Overview}
For this task, we have chosen the model developed in 
{\MYhref{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14016077}{Vergue, et al.}}\cite{measles}, ``Controlling Measles Using Supplemental Immunization Activities".  The following documentation explains the model developed by Vergue, et al. and draws heavily from \cite{measles}.



In \cite{measles}, the authors describe their Dynamic Measles Immunization Calculation Engine (DynaMICE), an age-stratified model of measles infection transmission in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The population in the model can be susceptible to measles, infected with measles or recovered from measles (and hence have life-long immunity). The rate at which infection occurs in the susceptible population depends on the existing proportion of the population that is already infected, as well as the effective contact rate between different age groups. In the original model, individuals age discretely, in one-year increments, at the end of each year, between 0 and 100 years old. For the current task, we have divided the population into two age groups, {\bf those under 5 years of age} and {\bf those 5 years of age and older}.

Vaccinated individuals are assumed to have a reduced risk of measles infection. Vaccine effectiveness is assumed to be 85\% for the first dose. Vaccines are assumed to be ``all or nothing," so that individuals receiving the vaccine are either fully protected or not at all. Vaccination is assumed to give lifetime protection if it successfully elicits an immune response and vaccinating already infected individuals does not increase the rate of infection clearance (i.e., the vaccine has no therapeutic action).


\subsubsection{Measles Background}
Measles has been a key contributor of under-five childhood mortality globally. Although measles mortality has dropped globally (from up to 5\% of under-five deaths in 2000 to about 1–2\% in 2010), measles burden remains high in a number of countries. Efforts aimed at decreasing measles prevalence have focused on maintaining high coverage of routine immunization of children at 9 to 12 months of age.
Despite these global reductions, measles mortality remains substantial and concentrated in a number of high measles-burdened countries.  For example, India accounted for almost 50\% (about 65,000 deaths) of estimated measles mortality in 2010, and the WHO Africa region for almost 40\% (about 50,000 deaths). 

\subsubsection{Modeling Measles}

A diagram displaying the components of the DynaMICE Model is given in Figure \ref{fig:MeaslesDiagram}.  The corresponding system of equations is given by Equation Systems (\ref{eqn:MeaslesUnder5}) - (\ref{eqn:MeaslesVaccinated}).

The parameters are as follows: $\tau$ is the effectiveness of a single measles vaccine; $\kappa (t)$ is the coverage rate of measles immunization for individuals vaccinated for the first time; $\alpha$ is the birth rate in the population; $\mu$ is the mortality rate and $\gamma$ is the infectiousness period of measles; and $\lambda$ is the rate at which susceptible individuals become infectious upon mutual contact.\\[2ex]

\section{Model Simulation}
\label{sec:Simulations}
Each model was implemented in Python 3.8.  Detailed documentation regarding how to run the models along with the parameter values used to generate the figures below are included in the project github.  The default values are named as follows; 
\begin{itemize}
    \item for cholera,  ``defaultCholeraSimulation.xlsx";
    \item for malaria, ``defaultMalariaSimulation.xlsx"; and,
    \item for measles, ``defaultMeaslesSimulation.xlsx".
\end{itemize}
In general, for each model, initial conditions and parameters values are set via an excel spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet serves as input to the model itself (written in Python).  By default, the output of the model variables is written to a spreadsheet titled according to the disease being simulated (i.e., ``Cholera.xlsx", ``Malaria.xlsx", or ``Measles.xlsx"). Below are sample simulations of each model using their respective default files as input.

\section{Future Directions}
\subsection{Somalia Use-Case}
At the time of this report, sub-national infectious disease data was not available for a full parameterization of each of the models. However, upon availability of incidence case data, the model for each infectious disease can be fit according to Section \ref{sec:Parameterization}.


\subsection{Planning Scenarios}
In addition to simulating baseline scenarios, the framework of model implementation allows for the simulation of theoretical scenarios. Scenarios are constructed by changing model parameters at various time points within the simulation. Documentation of how to change model parameters to simulate user-defined scenarios is included in the APL-provided code. Examples of which parameters might be linked with scenario simulations are given below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Cholera}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Adjustments to $\alpha$ might represent changes in water quality such as increased ability to treat the water (decreasing $\alpha$)
            \item Flooding events effect both the quality of water (increasing $\alpha$) as well as increases the rate at which humans interact with contaminated water (increasing $\beta_2$).
            \item Increases and decreases in availability of healthcare facilities are encompassed in the $b$ parameter.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Malaria}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Adjusting $\lambda_v$ adjusts the birth-rate of mosquitoes.  For example, this could be adjusted downward in the case of treating public spaces with insecticide or upwards in the case of flooding/excess standing water.  This parameter can also be adjusted seasonally to reflect the seasonal cycle of mosquito prevalence. 
            \item Use of mosquito nets, mosquito spray and other interventions designed to reduce the number of mosquito bites per person can be modeled via adjusting the $\nu_v$ parameter.
            \item Significant increase in the percentage of humans using prophylactics for the prevention of malaria could be simulated by adjusting the $c_{vh}$ parameter downwards.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Measles}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The primary factor that might be adjusted is the vaccination rates.  This is adjusted via the $\kappa (t)$ parameter. 
            \item Should a more effective vaccine become available, this would be reflected via changes in the $\tau$ parameter.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Limitations}
It is important to bear in mind that the basic assumptions described in Section \ref{sec:SIR} must be satisfied to produce valid results. As the models are developed independently of one another, joint effects between multiple models are not currently considered. Finally, models for each infectious disease have not been validated with real data, aside from what was completed during model publication by the original authors. As such, additional limitations are unknown, but may be brought to light as models are run using new parameterizations and scenarios.

\subsection{Towards A System Dynamics Model}
Within the context of supporting decision makers, any public health interventions fall short because they are made in piecemeal fashion, rather than from a whole-system perspective. A system dynamics model consists of interlocking sets of differential and algebraic equations [implemented as separate disease models] developed from relevant measured and experiential data \cite{systemsdynamics}.  This work represents the first steps towards the development of a systems dynamics model of infectious diseases.  The current models are implemented independently of each other; however, further development might allow for the the bi-directional linking of these models via other connections with other systems/infrastructure (e.g., health systems, food systems, climate/weather systems).
